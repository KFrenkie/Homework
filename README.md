Robot Framework

Preconditions

#Python:
Download the latest verison of python 3 from http://python.org under the downloads section

#Configuring PATH:
On Windows you can configure PATH by following the steps below. Notice that the exact setting names 
may be different on different Windows versions, but the basic approach should still be the same.
1.	Open Control Panel > System > Advanced > Environment Variables. 
      There are User variables and System variables, and the difference between them is that user variables
      affect only the current users, whereas system variables affect all users.
2.	To edit an existing PATH value, select Edit and add 
      ;<InstallationDir>;<ScriptsDir> at the end of the value (e.g. ;C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Scripts). 
      Note that the semicolons (;) are important as they separate the different entries. 
      To add a new PATH value, select New and set both the name and the value, this time without 
      the leading semicolon.
3.	Exit the dialog with Ok to save the changes.
4.	Start a new command prompt for the changes to take effect.

#Installing PIP
Starting from Python 2.7.9, the standard Windows installer by default installs and activates pip. 
Assuming you also have configured PATH and possibly set https_proxy, 
you can run pip install robotframework right after Python installation. 
With Python 3.4 and newer pip is officially part of the interpreter and should be automatically available.

In windows command prompt***:
*check python if it is properly installed:
python --version

*check pip if it is properly installed:
pip --version
